# Machine-Learning
This repository has simple and basic programs of Machine Learning implemented via Python and other supporting libraries

1) Fruit Classification using Machine Learning :
    Supporting Dataset : fruit_data_with_colors.txt
    
    Description : The fruits dataset was created by Dr. Iain Murray from University of Edinburgh. 
    He bought a few dozen oranges, lemons and apples of different varieties, and recorded their measurements in a table.
    
    Goal : Classify fruits into their respective category.
    
    Results : 100% with KNN and Decision Tree
    
2) Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule Learning 
    Supporting Dataset : Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv
    
    Description : The CSV contains about 7500 transcation of an imaginary supermarket. These transcations are arranged with items as coloumns.    
    
    Goal : Generate rules using Apriori algorithm
    
    Results : Few rules are generated indication X item can be bought with item Y.

3) Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning:
    Supporting Dataset : train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv and test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv
    
    Description : This dataset has 614 rows and 13 coloumns(including target) with attributes like gender,applicant income,
    marriage status and credit history and so on.    
    
    Goal : Predict whether loan can be approved or not based on features mentioned in dataset and test model on test set
    
    Results : Cross validation accuracy of 82% is achieved and open to all for further improvement.
    
4) Predict Malignancy in Breast Cancer:
    Supporting Dataset : train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv and test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv
    
    Description : This dataset has 614 rows and 13 coloumns(including target) with attributes like gender,applicant income,
    marriage status and credit history and so on.    
    
    Goal : Predict whether loan can be approved or not based on features mentioned in dataset and test model on test set
    
    Results : Cross validation accuracy of 82% is achieved and open to all for further improvement.
