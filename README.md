# Machine-Learning
This repository has simple and basic programs of Machine Learning implemented via Python and other supporting libraries

1) Fruit Classification using Machine Learning :
    Supporting Dataset : fruit_data_with_colors.txt
    
    Description : The fruits dataset was created by Dr. Iain Murray from University of Edinburgh. 
    He bought a few dozen oranges, lemons and apples of different varieties, and recorded their measurements in a table.
    
    Goal : Classify fruits into their respective category.
    
    Results : 100% with KNN and Decision Tree
    
2) Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule Learning 
    Supporting Dataset : Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv
    
    Description : The CSV contains about 7500 transcation of an imaginary supermarket. These transcations are arranged with items as coloumns.    
    
    Goal : Generate rules using Apriori algorithm
    
    Results : Few rules are generated indication X item can be bought with item Y.
